Regarding interactions with Kerberos: We could use python-kadmin here
(https://github.com/rjancewicz/python-kadmin), but it is not async-aware and
unmaintained since 2018.
Another option would be pexpect (https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect), which
has no 1st class support for asyncio though (i.e. spawning is not async).
Thus we roll out our own little version of expect to avoid specifying the
password on the commandline.
